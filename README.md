# **Advent of Code 2020**

Here is a repository of my personal solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2020) (written in java using jre1.8.0).

Each puzzle solution is its own main class under [src](src)\\\<corresponding day>.

Each of the puzzle inputs (and some test inputs I used) can be found under [Input](Input).

I won't be attempting to write the most optimized code possible, but will be trying to make use of any recent techniques I've learned.
